  We take pride in the dedication and commitment of our teaching staff.  Several of our staff members have been with Playschool for over <%= @big_years %> years, several for more than <%= @little_years %> years, and one for over 50 years!  Each classroom is staffed with a lead teacher and a co-teacher or teaching assistant and two parent helpers.  The presence of accredited staff, knowledgeable assistants and dedicated parent helpers in each classroom allows Playschool to offer the excellent child/adult ratio (4:1 or 5:1) that makes our unparalleled child-driven curriculum and activities possible.
